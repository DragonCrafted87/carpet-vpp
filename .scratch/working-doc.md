Before upgrading the mod to a newer Minecraft version (e.g., from 1.19.2 to 1.20+), it's a good opportunity to address code hygiene and structural issues. This will make the upgrade smoother by reducing technical debt, minimizing conflicts during code fixes (e.g., from API changes or renames), and improving maintainability. Based on Fabric best practices, common modding patterns, and upgrade preparation advice, here are my targeted suggestions. I've prioritized ones relevant to your codebase (e.g., heavy use of mixins, client/server separation, dev-specific logic, and build setup). These are not exhaustive but focus on high-impact changes.

### 1. **Code Organization and Structure**
   - **Separate Concerns More Clearly**: Your code is already somewhat modular (e.g., client/java for client-side classes, main/java for shared/server). However, consider further splitting:
     - Move bag-related logic (e.g., InventoryUtility, BaseBagItem, BagSlot) into a subpackage like `dragoncrafted87.vpp.bags` for better isolation. Do the same for beacon chunk loading (e.g., `dragoncrafted87.vpp.beacons` with BeaconChunkLoaderData).
     - Extract networking constants (MinecraftVPPNetworking) and screen handler interfaces (MinecraftVPPScreenHandler) into a `core` or `api` subpackage. This makes it easier to spot version-specific code during upgrades.
     - Reason: As the mod grows or during upgrades, isolated features are easier to test and refactor. For example, if Minecraft changes inventory APIs in a future version, you can focus fixes in one place.
   - **Use Records for Simple Data Classes**: Since you're on Java 17 (compatible with 1.19.2+), replace plain classes like BagTooltipData or StewInfo with records where possible (e.g., `record BagTooltipData(DefaultedList<ItemStack> inventory, int slotCount) {}`). This reduces boilerplate and improves readability.
   - **Minimize and Refactor Mixins**: You have several mixins (e.g., for BeaconBlockEntity, Blocks, InventoryScreen, PlayerScreenHandler). Fabric recommends keeping mixins to a minimum to avoid fragility and conflicts during upgrades:
     - Audit if any can be replaced with Fabric API events or native hooks (e.g., use `ServerTickEvents` instead of injecting into BeaconBlockEntity.tick if possible).
     - For BlocksMixin (changing block strengths), consider if this could be data-driven in newer versions (e.g., via JSON overrides if Minecraft supports it post-upgrade).
     - Use unique, descriptive names for injected methods/fields to prevent conflicts (e.g., prefix with `vpp_`).
     - Reason: Mixins often break during upgrades due to code refactors in Minecraft. Reducing them now will save time later.

### 2. **Code Hygiene Improvements**
   - **Add Javadocs and Comments**: Your code has some inline comments, but expand to full Javadocs for public methods/classes (e.g., in BaseBagItem, InventoryUtility). Document assumptions, like why certain slots are hardcoded (e.g., MAX_SATCHEL_SLOTS). This helps during upgrades when you need to recall why something was done a certain way.
   - **Handle Errors and Edge Cases Better**: In places like inventoryFromTag or onEquip/onUnequip, add more null checks or logging for invalid NBT/stacks. In MinecraftVPPServer, your try-catch for saving ops is good—extend similar patterns to file I/O or network packets.
   - **Remove or Configure Hardcoded Dev Logic**: The dev environment checks in MinecraftVPPServer (opping players, unlocking recipes) are useful but hardcoded. Move them behind a config flag (e.g., using Fabric's config API like Cloth Config or a simple properties file in run/):
     - Create a `DevConfig` class that loads from a file (e.g., `dev_mode=true`).
     - This prevents accidental deployment to production servers and makes testing more flexible.
   - **Consistent Naming and Conventions**: Follow Java/Minecraft conventions strictly:
     - Use camelCase for methods/variables (you mostly do).
     - Make constants final static (e.g., in DebugFlags).
     - Avoid magic numbers; define them as constants (e.g., pyramid levels in BeaconChunkLoaderData).
     - Suppress warnings where justified (e.g., `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` for casts in mixins).
   - **Unused/Dead Code Cleanup**: Scan for redundancies, like duplicated drawTexture calls in InventoryScreenMixin or similar logic in left/right pouch handling—factor into helper methods.
   - **Testing and Debugging**: Add unit tests for non-MC dependent logic (e.g., InventoryUtility methods) using JUnit. For MC-specific, use runClient/runServer more in CI if you set up GitHub Actions.

### 3. **Build and Dependency Management**
   - **Update Build Tools Early**: Before the full upgrade, bump to the latest compatible Loom/Fabric Loader in build.gradle (check https://fabricmc.net/develop for 1.19.2-stable versions). This fixes any deprecations.
   - **Version Management in gradle.properties**: You already use this well (e.g., minecraft_version=1.19.2). Add comments for each property and ensure all deps (Trinkets, EMI) are pinned to compatible versions. Consider using a version catalog (Gradle 7+) for centralized dep management.
   - **Access Widener and Mappings**: Your accesswidener is set—verify it's minimal. During upgrades, remap sources with `gradlew genSources` after version changes.
   - **Multi-Version Prep**: If planning multi-version support (e.g., 1.19.2 + 1.20+), consider tools like MultiMC or Architectury Loom to build for multiple targets without duplicating code.

### 4. **Specific Prep for Version Upgrades**
   - **Backup and Version Control**: Commit the current state to Git. Create a branch for the upgrade (e.g., `upgrade-1.20`).
   - **Isolate Version-Specific Code**: Wrap any MC-version-dependent logic in if-checks or separate classes (e.g., use `MinecraftVersion` helper to handle API differences post-upgrade).
   - **Follow a Standard Upgrade Process**:
     - Copy the project.
     - Update gradle.properties (minecraft_version, yarn_mappings, loader_version, fabric_version) from https://fabricmc.net/develop.
     - Run `gradlew build` or `runClient` and fix compile/runtime errors (e.g., renamed methods via code comparison in IDE).
     - Test thoroughly; mods may break subtly due to MC changes (e.g., inventory or beacon logic).
     - If quick-testing, edit fabric.mod.json "depends" to force compatibility, but this risks crashes—use only for verification.
   - **Potential Issues in Your Mod**: Expect fixes for mixins (e.g., Beacon/Blocks changes in newer MC), Trinkets/EMI deps (update their versions), and Java 21 requirement post-1.20.5.

Implementing these should take 1-2 days for a mod this size and make future maintenance easier. If the mod grows, consider adopting a full CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions for builds). Let me know if you want code snippets for any of these!
